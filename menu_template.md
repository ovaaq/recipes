Choose a theme: Before creating a full course menu, decide on a theme, cuisine, or set of flavors to base your meal around. This preparation makes it easier to decide on a menu and ensures continuity throughout the courses.

Decide on a season or region: Consider basing your full course meal on the season, or feature cuisines from one or several regions.

Build around the main course: Whatever theme you choose for your meal, ensure it can provide a solid main course, and work the rest of the courses and theme elements around it.
